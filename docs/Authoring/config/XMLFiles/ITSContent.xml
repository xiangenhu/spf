  <Initiation>
    <TextDisplay>The enemies the United States is fighting today—and is likely to fight for many years to come—are continuously and consciously evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of our military, aiming to avoid our power and attack our vulnerabilities. The U.S. government should therefore constantly evaluate its effectiveness in using all elements of national power to learn and adapt more quickly than do its enemies. Learning organizations defeat insurgencies; armies that are not learning organizations do not. Effective learning organizations encourage individuals to pay attention to the rapidly changing situations that characterize COIN campaigns—rapid enemy innovation, shifting attitudes of local populations, local civilian leadership turmoil.</TextDisplay>
